1. Create the question and the answer environments. These environments are created using \newenvironment but should these be
 created using ntheorem or amsthm's theorem environments?

2. How to get Kile to compile the entire project from any doument in the project? Turns out that Alt + 6 will work, but you have to 
explicitly add the file to the project.

3. Add the package that ensures that equations are only numbered if they are referred to in the body of the text. 

4. Add fancy headers and footers to the document. 

5. How can you center a tabular environment without nesting it within a float environment.
